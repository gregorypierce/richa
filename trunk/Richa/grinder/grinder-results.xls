	"Conclusions"												
	"1. Jelly is CPU intensive and does not leverage caching in its current configuration"												
	"2. JSF is quite memory intensive, and this will likely become more apparent when more markup is added. It is important to note that no backing bean was used, so HTTP Session backing beans aren't in play."												
	"3. I think we need to take a closer look at facelets and see if it makes sense to build a knock-off."
